          "description": "A bunch of best friends who grew up in the Buffalo, NY area making music throughout our childhood and teenage years. From left to right: Eddy, TJ, Kim, Bethany, Miles, Ethan. These songs were written by us from approximately 2003 to 2005. Think of this album as audio lore for early Doerfel/Fonda-verse music! \n\nMiles fronted much of the songwriting and arrangements of these songs, and I(TJ) felt this would be a fun album to release in Miles' honor. While I love ALL these songs, \"Ode to Ashley\" really captured the joy Miles and I had making music together. Thanks Ashley!\n\nWe didn't have autotune back then, but there is something beautiful about the rawness of these tracks. Until we get to jam again in heaven, we love and miss you Miles, and may your music live on forever!\n------------\nMiles Fonda(4/15/88 to 1/21/23) - Drums, lead vocals.\nBethany Fonda - Lead and backing vocals.\nKim Doerfel - Lead and backing vocals, fiddle.\nTJ Doerfel - Guitars.\nEddy Doerfel - Bass and mandolin.\nEthan Fonda - percussion and band jester.\n\nTo see what everyone is up to now check out https://www.doerfelverse.com and https://www.bethanyfonda.com/\n\nMiles' splits go to his son Kaden.\nSpecial thanks to our parents(Ralph and Tamala Fonda, Tom and Cheryl Doerfel) for helping us on our musical journey.",

          "summary": "A bunch of best friends who grew up in the Buffalo, NY area making music throughout our childhood and teenage years. From left to right: Eddy, TJ, Kim, Bethany, Miles, Ethan. These songs were written by us from approximately 2003 to 2005. Think of this album as audio lore for early Doerfel/Fonda-verse music! \n\nMiles fronted much of the songwriting and arrangements of these songs, and I(TJ) felt this would be a fun album to release in Miles' honor. While I love ALL these songs, \"Ode to Ashley\" really captured the joy Miles and I had making music together. Thanks Ashley!\n\nWe didn't have autotune back then, but there is something beautiful about the rawness of these tracks. Until we get to jam again in heaven, we love and miss you Miles, and may your music live on forever!\n------------\nMiles Fonda(4/15/88 to 1/21/23) - Drums, lead vocals.\nBethany Fonda - Lead and backing vocals.\nKim Doerfel - Lead and backing vocals, fiddle.\nTJ Doerfel - Guitars.\nEddy Doerfel - Bass and mandolin.\nEthan Fonda - percussion and band jester.\n\nTo see what everyone is up to now check out https://www.doerfelverse.com and https://www.bethanyfonda.com/\n\nMiles' splits go to his son Kaden.\nSpecial thanks to our parents(Ralph and Tamala Fonda, Tom and Cheryl Doerfel) for helping us on our musical journey.",

Produced and recorded by Bob Hoag in late 2022 at Flying Blanket Studios in Mesa, AZ.\n\nAt times a darkly sonic and emotional hand grenade and others a poppy shimmering rainbow of rich melodies and textures, 'deathdreams' is a tour de force that showcases the depth of Whitehurst’s songwriting, lyrical imagery, and vocal fortitude. Far-ranging in its topic matter, the album touches on the themes of anxiety, the power of cinema, and the dangers of societal influences, in addition to Whitehurst’s dreams about dying.",

          "summary": "'deathdreams' was written and performed by Emily Whitehurst, the solo artist behind Survival Guide. Produced and recorded by Bob Hoag in late 2022 at Flying Blanket Studios in Mesa, AZ.\n\nAt times a darkly sonic and emotional hand grenade and others a poppy shimmering rainbow of rich melodies and textures, 'deathdreams' is a tour de force that showcases the depth of Whitehurst’s songwriting, lyrical imagery, and vocal fortitude. Far-ranging in its topic matter, the album touches on the themes of anxiety, the power of cinema, and the dangers of societal influences, in addition to Whitehurst’s dreams about dying.",

The stories, best encapsulated by this live album, (acoustically and stripped back the way they were originally conceived and written) take the listener on a journey lived through Joe’s eyes. From the US state-roaming anecdotes of ‘Denver’ to the stargazing, space traveling tale of ‘Daddy Gene’, Joe’s unique blend of UK and US influences are best heard in this live setting.\n\nOne man, his guitar and his stories of the first five years!\n\nTo get a limited physical copy, visit https://www.joemartinmusic.com/merch",

The stories, best encapsulated by this live album, (acoustically and stripped back the way they were originally conceived and written) take the listener on a journey lived through Joe’s eyes. From the US state-roaming anecdotes of ‘Denver’ to the stargazing, space traveling tale of ‘Daddy Gene’, Joe’s unique blend of UK and US influences are best heard in this live setting.\n\nOne man, his guitar and his stories of the first five years!\n\nTo get a limited physical copy, visit https://www.joemartinmusic.com/merch",

He promised his young daughter Tracy that he'd bring her back a moonbeam and wrote her initials in the lunar dust.

We finally have a private, anonymous, and censorship resistant media: the compact cassette. Historically, cassettes have toppled governments, sparked moral panics, and spread subversive messages. But are they still relevant today besides hipster nostalgia? Join me as I recount the transformative history of cassettes, uncovering the parallel societies they have built and explore their modern applications.In today’s age of pervasive surveillance, the portable, offline, and analog nature of cassettes offers a renewed sense of relevance and freedom. I’ll cover cypherpunk applications of cassettes including innovative uses in backups, ecash, steganography, and analog and digital encryption. And just for fun, you will learn how to make tape loops and DIY sound on sound recording as well. So, get ready to press record and learn how analog recording can aid us in the fight for self-sovereignty and freedom.Call 1-877-BIT-LOFI and leave crazy messages on a real cassette!How to get a physical tape:Mail a postcard with your return address to\n                 P.O.

In a v4v live music showcase The Trusted, Red Arrow Highway, MOOKY, and City Beach make up our tallent for the night. \nThe Artist guides you through our spectacle with his tales and poems. As we flip through the pages of our past accounts and create some new ones right in front of you.\nAh yes you. How can we forget to mention your role in this show?\nTonight we ask you to engage in a thing we call Value for Value. What could this mean? That means we have put this production out for your viewing pleasure with zero paywalls nor a single corporate sponsorship. All we ask of you is that you consider adding value back in any way you see fit. This show only holds such magick when those who contribute, choose to reach out and touch it on their own. \nHow does one add value?\nTime.  Talent. Treasure. You&rsquo;ve shown up to watch, you&rsquo;re already contributing value through your time with us. For the next spectacle you could consider joining the team, whether that&rsquo;s joining our ever growing crew of artists and technicians, or even becoming one of our acts that we showcase. For now though we have a pretty easy way for you to make your mark on these pages&hellip;\nA Boost. \nWhat could that be? \nA boost is voluntary payment of bitcoin to the acts, the crew, or the show as a whole.\n\nSo You Want To Boost?\n\nThis boost is not just a form of value contribution. It&rsquo;s an interactive experience. When you send in a boost you will see your name and amount appear in the show while also triggering the art we&rsquo;ve made for you. There is also a scoreboard ledger for the top boosters&hellip;not that it&rsquo;s a competition. Your contribution will forever be immortalized in our live to tape storytale.\nThe bloom has begun Martha.",

The era ended when my Macintosh SE's screen finally gave out, since UpBeat was not compatible with new versions of Apple's operating systems. The other important piece of software, Studio Vision also went by the wayside with the demise of Opcode. It had easy-to-construct subsequences that could be linked together, resulting in clear jumps from one texture to another. The computer went out in the trash one day, like my IBM PC-XT did, the one I wrote the first programmable instrument programs on with Rick Bidlack.

A brash assault on the powers that want to choke us out with the proverbial knee to the neck. We retaliate with our unrelenting and everlasting voices demanding our freedom of speech.PoundSauce- Like someone on a rampage, a drinking anthem that could be our dark take on \"Fight for your Right to Party\"? This song is simple and minimal with the power and intention of a bull in a china shop. To this day, we love playing this song. This was one of the first original 6 songs that we wrote to open up for Ministry on the Land of Rape and Honey tour, our live debut.I got it made- Another one of those original 6 songs and no one has written one like it since. We enjoyed this song being on \"The Texas Chainsaw Massacre...the next generation.\" The scene where Matthew McConaughey is driving the tow-truck over and over his victim makes for the perfect music video for this track.Regret-The first single on our sophomore release and our only video track for the album What a Mangled Web we Leave. The video featured Michael Jackson's attorney as the clown luring a young Macauley Culkin \"looking\" kid into our demented Carnaval. The song represented the dark drug induced phase that was my life at the time. Family Values- This track was up for a remix by Ice Cube's producer at the time but the record label went bankrupt right before our European tour with Tool was scheduled. On the bright side,Mike Dean of Geto Boys fame played keyboards on it.Sign the dotted line- Be careful what you wish. The drugs that once fueled my creativity and made up a large part of who I believed I was had now turned into the contract that I had sold my soul for. From the outside looking in, a fun ride through the gutters of a dark mind. Mike Dean plays a sinister riff on the Moog.\nMt Carmel Cookout- The prelude to Ranch Apocalypse, a Texan's view on a Texas debacle. David Koresh inspired followers and caught the attention of many others including our government's ATF. This track sets the tone for the next track. I remember telling Mat Mitchell that he had destroyed my hit by adding the burning babies to this song. Man the drugs were something at the time! Ranch Apocalypse- If you've ever spent a day in Waco you will realize that this was one of many stories that can be told but certainly the most famous. What started as a smart-ass t-shirt turned into 2 songs on the album What a Mangled Web...We Leave. The Branch Davideans and the ATF left a Texas sized brand on Waco and all involved. we just wrote the soundtrack to it.\nAt War with Myself- Heavy and dark, this track was a self discovery about the destruction and turmoil I had inflicted on myself over many years. The struggle is real and you can bet that there is no surrender when the fight is internal. We are crowded in here and we don't always get along.\nSay What You Mean- And mean what you say, I'm not sure of how to say this more clearly. This is one of my favorite tracks on our third album Adult Entertainment for Kids. Featuring Chris Gates of Big Boys and Junkyard fame on guitar. I love playing this song live. It is fun to sing and the message will never die. \ncredits\nreleased August 28, 2020\n\nAll tracks written and produced by Skatenigs except those credited to Al Jourgensen",

          "summary": "Volume 2 of the Classics!\nLiner notes:\nShow me where they touched you...againLoudspeaker- Our first video track with Wax Trax Records. Shut up and Listen! A brash assault on the powers that want to choke us out with the proverbial knee to the neck. We retaliate with our unrelenting and everlasting voices demanding our freedom of speech.PoundSauce- Like someone on a rampage, a drinking anthem that could be our dark take on \"Fight for your Right to Party\"? This song is simple and minimal with the power and intention of a bull in a china shop. To this day, we love playing this song. This was one of the first original 6 songs that we wrote to open up for Ministry on the Land of Rape and Honey tour, our live debut.I got it made- Another one of those original 6 songs and no one has written one like it since. We enjoyed this song being on \"The Texas Chainsaw Massacre...the next generation.\" The scene where Matthew McConaughey is driving the tow-truck over and over his victim makes for the perfect music video for this track.Regret-The first single on our sophomore release and our only video track for the album What a Mangled Web we Leave. The video featured Michael Jackson's attorney as the clown luring a young Macauley Culkin \"looking\" kid into our demented Carnaval. The song represented the dark drug induced phase that was my life at the time. Family Values- This track was up for a remix by Ice Cube's producer at the time but the record label went bankrupt right before our European tour with Tool was scheduled. On the bright side,Mike Dean of Geto Boys fame played keyboards on it.Sign the dotted line- Be careful what you wish. The drugs that once fueled my creativity and made up a large part of who I believed I was had now turned into the contract that I had sold my soul for. From the outside looking in, a fun ride through the gutters of a dark mind. Mike Dean plays a sinister riff on the Moog.\nMt Carmel Cookout- The prelude to Ranch Apocalypse, a Texan's view on a Texas debacle. David Koresh inspired followers and caught the attention of many others including our government's ATF. This track sets the tone for the next track. I remember telling Mat Mitchell that he had destroyed my hit by adding the burning babies to this song. Man the drugs were something at the time! Ranch Apocalypse- If you've ever spent a day in Waco you will realize that this was one of many stories that can be told but certainly the most famous. What started as a smart-ass t-shirt turned into 2 songs on the album What a Mangled Web...We Leave. The Branch Davideans and the ATF left a Texas sized brand on Waco and all involved. we just wrote the soundtrack to it.\nAt War with Myself- Heavy and dark, this track was a self discovery about the destruction and turmoil I had inflicted on myself over many years. The struggle is real and you can bet that there is no surrender when the fight is internal. We are crowded in here and we don't always get along.\nSay What You Mean- And mean what you say, I'm not sure of how to say this more clearly. This is one of my favorite tracks on our third album Adult Entertainment for Kids. Featuring Chris Gates of Big Boys and Junkyard fame on guitar. I love playing this song live. It is fun to sing and the message will never die. \ncredits\nreleased August 28, 2020\n\nAll tracks written and produced by Skatenigs except those credited to Al Jourgensen",

Not very successful because of the weird tonal changes between sit-com and dark crime. This might have influenced both Frasier and Twin Peaks, which gives you an idea of the ground they were attempting to cover.",

There is still space and mood, but also melodies and rhythm with snappy drums and bass grooves.\nIt also connects my oldest surviving tracks (I didn’t used to keep much back then, it would just come and go), with my more recent Bonkwave/Not Bonkwave tracks.\nAll those influences are merged into a coherent picture, vocal guitars going from 50s pop to modern day Chill Hop, folk rock and psychedelic rhythm guitar bleed into ambient textures.\nI don’t often make music using anything other than guitar anymore, but when I do this is the sort of thing that comes out.\nYou can download lossless (higher quality audio) versions of these tracks from my website over here.",

One wedding happened to be earlier in the day, the other later, and I was able to wear the same dress to both since the brides chose the same color. It was meant to be all the way around.

With a bit of this and a bit of that, the end product amped up Anni's singer-songwriter style to full production pop-rock with notes of jazz. Anni wrote the music and lyrics and performed the vocals, piano and synth. Kristopher Ewaniuk produced, mixed & mastered, and added guitar and bass. Anni's sister Vicki played drums, brass by Rachel Ewaniuk, and back up vocals by Anni's husband, Toby, and friends Chelsea Lyn Meyer and Mike Geroni.

One distinct style that appeared was kind of accoustic-based from a guitar sound point of view, but often effected with glitch delays and stutters as well as some flowing loops.\nIt seems to have a pastoral or nature theme which I’ve then reflected in the titles as meaningful imagery and botanical references that I think match up to the content. It reflects a slightly different approach and a new guitar to play with! Although it is different, it doesn’t vary wildly from what I do (after all, I don’t vary wildly at my core and through all of these that’s what I’ve been attemping to capture). So familiar, but different.\nVisit Strange Textures for more information and music.  You can get lossless (higher quality audio) versions of my albums there to download and keep.",

Beyond veils, here I am in each moment letting the flow move me and the music.\nThese are highlights from Season Five of the podcast. I wanted to get back to playing without too much thought or structure and see what came out. One distinct style that appeared was kind of accoustic-based from a guitar sound point of view, but often effected with glitch delays and stutters as well as some flowing loops.\nIt seems to have a pastoral or nature theme which I’ve then reflected in the titles as meaningful imagery and botanical references that I think match up to the content. It reflects a slightly different approach and a new guitar to play with! Although it is different, it doesn’t vary wildly from what I do (after all, I don’t vary wildly at my core and through all of these that’s what I’ve been attemping to capture). So familiar, but different.\nVisit Strange Textures for more information and music.  You can get lossless (higher quality audio) versions of my albums there to download and keep.",

I wanted to get back to playing without too much thought or structure and see what came out. These parts came together as a reflection of ‘the usual’ ambient improvisation but with a freer twist. They don’t venture too far from ambient guitar, but are looser than previous attempts.\nThey have that quality of revealing an inner state but remain connected to admittedly odd imagery based on real life. It’s a step away from nature, which happened in An Observed Earth and gives a glimpse further inside me. There feels like a connection with Marchland Stars here so the title reflects the link while the track titles refelct aspects of my mindset when creating them.\nMore information and music at Strange Textures.  You can get lossless (higher quality audio) versions of my albums there to download and keep.",

Produced and recorded by Bob Hoag in late 2022 at Flying Blanket Studios in Mesa, AZ.\n\nAt times a darkly sonic and emotional hand grenade and others a poppy shimmering rainbow of rich melodies and textures, 'deathdreams' is a tour de force that showcases the depth of Whitehurst’s songwriting, lyrical imagery, and vocal fortitude. Far-ranging in its topic matter, the album touches on the themes of anxiety, the power of cinema, and the dangers of societal influences, in addition to Whitehurst’s dreams about dying.",

          "summary": "As you press play on \"Home Sweet Home (The Dream of Love Survives but it Disappoints Constantly),\" the opening notes of the electronic instrumental album send a shiver down your spine. The haunting melodies and dissonant harmonies seem to echo through the empty spaces of a world long forgotten, evoking images of a desolate landscape where hope and happiness are distant memories. The album's electronic instrumentation is both eerie and ethereal, capturing the shattered and broken nature of a dystopian world in a hauntingly beautiful way. The persistent dream of love that survives, but disappoints constantly, is a poignant reminder of the fragility of human emotion and the power of hope in the face of adversity. This album is a powerful reflection on the human condition, a warning of what can happen when we neglect to nurture the things that truly matter in life, and a call to fight for a better future where love and hope can once again flourish in a world that has been left to decay.",

I would say this is relaxing, acoustic, instrumental music. I made this as a solo project while performing with The Doerfels, the band I started with four of my younger brothers and our only sister. \nAnyways, If you dare to listen, Beware of Banjo!\n\nIf you receive any value from this music, which I loved making, please let me know with any kind of value!

Each track is carefully crafted with meticulous attention to detail, resulting in a cohesive and seamless listening experience that takes the listener on a journey through a kaleidoscope of moods and emotions.\n\nThe beats are crisp and driving, providing a solid foundation for the soaring melodies that weave their way through the tracks. At times, the music is contemplative and introspective, with atmospheric pads and intricate arpeggios that evoke a sense of calm and reflection. At other times, the energy ramps up to dizzying heights, with pounding basslines and euphoric chord progressions that inspire movement and celebration.\n\nWhether you're starting your day with a cup of coffee, hitting the gym for a morning workout, or just need a burst of energy to power through your day, Good Morning is the perfect soundtrack for any occasion. Its infectious rhythms and uplifting melodies are sure to put a smile on your face and leave you feeling inspired and motivated.",

We recorded live at Trax studio in Chicago under the direction of Al Jourgensen. Lorri Jackson wrote the prologue and performed it the next day. Al worked his magic. Jim and Danny at Wax Trax records loved it and the rest is history.\n\nShit Authority- This was the first track the band had ever written. It started with a 2 Live Crew beat, a punk riff and a general disdain for authority.\n\nHorny for Evil- Al and I had joked around during Beers, Steers and Queers session about writing a song about how many lives are murdered with each ejaculation and there you have it. The phone call intro was Phildo calling from studio B to studio A at Trax studio. Critter took the call and recorded it. By the way, stupid people really shouldn’t breed.\n\nPassion for Destruction- One of the first songs written for the sophomore release What a Mangled Web We Leave. Inspired by the band mascot, a pit bull named Grunt, amongst many reasons why we can’t have nice things.\n\nTexas Tattoo- Possibly the origin for the idea to build a wall on the Texas border except our concept was to build it on the north border between Oklahoma and our great country.\n\nHoosegow- Lets just say jail is never a great place to be but even worse if that jail is in Mexico. Can’t say I remember a whole lot from my trips to see Dr Lopez and the family pharmacy in Nuevo Laredo but I can say the statute of limitations is my friend.\n\nCar Crash- We we’re trying to create a song that was fast and furious without it just being another thrash track. Mark Dufour masterfully cut the riff and the beat up to give this song it’s mechanical splendor. The rest relied on speed and a lot of it! *Al really wanted this track for a Revolting Cocks song but I made the choice to keep it for the album Adult Entertainment for Kids.\n\nStick it In- Everyone loves the Cramps and so do I. This was our take on rockabilly or hellbilly or whatever. We still enjoy playing this one and I hope we do another one soon.\n\nWake up- If there is ever such a thing as goth rap I want credit for it. This song explores the doom and gloom of the world we have created for ourselves. The bass line I wrote on a mini moog at the original Musiclab in Austin. \ncredits\nreleased August 28, 2020\n\nAll tracks written and produced by Skatenigs except those that are credited to Al Jourgensen.",

          "summary": "A bunch of best friends who grew up in the Buffalo, NY area making music throughout our childhood and teenage years. From left to right: Eddy, TJ, Kim, Bethany, Miles, Ethan. These songs were written by us from approximately 2003 to 2005. Think of this album as audio lore for early Doerfel/Fonda-verse music! \n\nMiles fronted much of the songwriting and arrangements of these songs, and I(TJ) felt this would be a fun album to release in Miles' honor. While I love ALL these songs, \"Ode to Ashley\" really captured the joy Miles and I had making music together. Thanks Ashley!\n\nWe didn't have autotune back then, but there is something beautiful about the rawness of these tracks. Until we get to jam again in heaven, we love and miss you Miles, and may your music live on forever!\n------------\nMiles Fonda(4/15/88 to 1/21/23) - Drums, lead vocals.\nBethany Fonda - Lead and backing vocals.\nKim Doerfel - Lead and backing vocals, fiddle.\nTJ Doerfel - Guitars.\nEddy Doerfel - Bass and mandolin.\nEthan Fonda - percussion and band jester.\n\nTo see what everyone is up to now check out https://www.doerfelverse.com and https://www.bethanyfonda.com/\n\nMiles' splits go to his son Kaden.\nSpecial thanks to our parents(Ralph and Tamala Fonda, Tom and Cheryl Doerfel) for helping us on our musical journey.",

Only the Yamaha KX76 controller and acoustic guitar remain, now in proximity to an iMac running Pro Tools LE and Reason, and a lone piece of outboard gear–an antique Digitech Vocalist harmonizer. Most of the synthesis and processing were done “in the box”. The improvement in sound quality was as inspiring as the excitement experienced with earlier setups. The sounds have gotten clearer, and the forms more linear, with smoother transitions between sections. An abundance of audio tracks and types of processing are available, along with new editing options. The whole process is sped up, which is good, because I have less time to compose now.“May I ?” was done with Reason. I never figured out exactly what was causing the weird plucking sound, or how to control its volume, but appreciate its serendipitous contribution.",

The song structure is buoyant, featuring a jaunty rhythm that skips and hops like the fantastical creatures it's named after. There's a prominent use of bell-like synth tones that mimic the sound of a xylophone, adding to the enchanting, fanciful vibe.

The composition of \"Cataracts\" features a slow-burning build-up, where arrhythmic beats create a sense of disorientation akin to the visual impairment the title suggests.
