# StableKraft Music App - ITDV Playlist Integration PRD

## Project Overview
The StableKraft music app needs to integrate the Into The Doerfel-Verse (ITDV) playlist with real audio URLs and artwork, and create a reusable system for adding multiple playlists to the site's centralized music database.

## Current Features
The ITDV playlist currently displays 114 resolved song titles and artists with generated durations, but cannot play audio due to missing audio URLs.

### Core Functionality
- Static display of 114 ITDV playlist tracks
- Generated contextual track durations
- Integration with existing AudioContext playback system
- Main music page with existing track database

### Technical Features
- RSS feed parsing infrastructure
- V4V (Value for Value) resolution system
- Centralized music-tracks.json database
- Audio playback prevention for invalid URLs

## Future Enhancements
Create a complete playlist integration system that supports multiple playlists with real audio playback.

### User Experience
- Full audio playback for ITDV playlist tracks
- Track artwork display alongside titles/artists
- ITDV tracks available on main page
- Seamless integration with existing UI

### Technical Improvements
- Batch RSS feed processing for audio URL resolution
- Artwork extraction from iTunes and media tags
- Caching system for resolved URLs and metadata
- Reusable playlist component for future playlists
- Database integration preventing duplicate entries

## Technical Architecture
Next.js app with API routes for RSS feed processing and database management.

### Frontend
- React components with TypeScript
- ITDVPlaylistAlbum component
- Existing AudioContext integration
- Main page track display

### Backend
- `/api/resolve-audio-urls` - Batch RSS feed processing
- `/api/add-playlist-to-database` - Database integration
- `/api/resolve-itdv-audio` - ITDV-specific testing
- XML parsing for enclosure URLs and artwork
- 24-hour caching for resolved data

## Success Metrics
- All 114 ITDV tracks can be played with real audio
- Track artwork displays for resolved tracks
- ITDV tracks appear on main page
- System supports adding additional playlists
- No performance degradation from processing

## Technical Requirements
- RSS feed XML parsing for enclosure URLs
- iTunes image and duration metadata extraction
- Batch processing with rate limiting
- Integration with existing music-tracks.json structure
- Compatibility with current AudioContext playbook
- Error handling for failed RSS requests
- Caching to minimize repeated API calls
