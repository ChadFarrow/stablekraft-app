description: Parse podcast RSS feeds and extract metadata including episodes, chapters, and music track information

instructions: |
  Parse RSS feeds using the project's RSS parser library to extract structured metadata.

  Key capabilities:
  - Parse RSS/Atom feeds with podcast namespace extensions
  - Extract episode metadata (title, description, audio URL, duration)
  - Parse podcast chapters (start time, title)
  - Extract Value4Value time splits and payment info
  - Handle podcast:liveItem tags for live content
  - Extract music track information from chapters

  When parsing feeds:
  1. Use the RSSParser class from lib/rss-parser/index.ts
  2. Handle both regular <item> and <podcast:liveItem> tags
  3. Extract V4V data for Lightning payments
  4. Parse chapters for music track boundaries
  5. Validate and sanitize all URLs
  6. Handle errors gracefully with retries

  Example usage:
  ```typescript
  import { RSSParser } from '@/lib/rss-parser';

  const album = await RSSParser.parseAlbumFeed('https://example.com/feed.xml');

  console.log(`Parsed: ${album.title}`);
  console.log(`Tracks: ${album.tracks.length}`);
  console.log(`V4V Recipient: ${album.value4Value?.lightning_address}`);
  ```

  The parser automatically:
  - Extracts cover art from multiple sources
  - Parses durations and converts to seconds
  - Cleans HTML content from descriptions
  - Resolves artist and album information
  - Extracts funding and publisher data
